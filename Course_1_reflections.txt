I found that looking at both files side-by-side was useful for identifying quickly and visually the differences,
mostly because the lines were few in number.

Having older versions of a file on hand is very useful for me because it will allow me to restore a version if I have 
made a mistake or there has been a problem.

Git saves across multiple files because it is intended for integrated software products, no standalone scripts.

One can use git log to see the changes made to files over the course of its git history, diff shows the specifics of what was changed.

Using version control would make me more confident to add changes that might break the code because I can return to the working version easily and visibly.

I want to use git in order to streamline the FPInnovations Computed Tomography reconstruction code.
